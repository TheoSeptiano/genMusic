My dissertation project
This project generates a sequence of music notes in ABC Notation format in the C Major Key.
All notes can be: 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 3 or 4 seconds in duration.
The probailities of a given outcome can be adjusted by altering the numbers in the probs (probabilities) tables. Higher numbers means more likely.

Run the project passing a number as argument in the debug launch profile. This number will be the number of bars the system generates.
